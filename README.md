# Marvel Snap Player Stats
## What is it?
### A Python script that reads data from the game files stored in your device and compiles it into a nice webpage. 
### Data shown includes account history, collection, ranked, conquest and card statistics.
&nbsp;
## How does it work?
### This script only reads data from the game files stored in your device. These files are visible to anyone and all the data is easily accessible with a simple file explorer tool.
### This is just a compiler to speed up the process so you don't have to search everything manually.
### The script does not export the data or edit it in any way. Everything is executed locally on your device.
### Note: You will need Python installed on your PC or an app that can run Python on your mobile.
&nbsp;
## How to use it?
### In this git page, click on the green "Code" button, download the zip and extract it in your device. Then:
### PC: To execute the script just execute file "generate_file.py". This will create a file called for example stats_28-August-2023-211822.html in the same folder and open it automatically on a browser.
### Android: (Seems to not work in Android 13 for now) If you are browsing on android make sure to select "Desktop Site" so you see the green "Code" download button. Then use an app (tested on Pydroid3) that let's you execute a Python file and execute file "generate_file.py". This will create a file called for example stats_28-August-2023-211822.html in the same folder that you need to open manually on a browser.
### iPhone: Not available at this time. Currently working on making it possible.
